## Regenerative Breaking


Regenerative braking in electric cars helps recharge the battery by converting kinetic energy back into electricity. However, the energy recovery rate is not purely linearâ€”it depends on speed and braking duration.

This week, let's build a program that estimates how much energy can be recovered during braking using a more realistic efficiency model.

ðŸ¥… Goal: Let's create a program that calculates the energy regenerated while keeping in mind that energy recovery is highest at moderate speeds and decreases at both low and high speeds.
